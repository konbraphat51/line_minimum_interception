# Line Minimum Intersection

Optimization of minimum movement of lines when all lines need to move to intersect into a single point.

## How to use

Use `calculate_minimum_movements()`

You can see sample on `unit_test.py`

### Visualization

The easy visualization of the optimization result can be runned by `visualize.py`
